Using the Fusion 360 Pyton API, Can you create a function called camera_orbit that will be used to create a viewport animation.

I will accept the following arguments: camera_eye_start_radius, camera_eye_start_z, camera_eye_end_radius, camera_eye_end_z, camera_focus, rotation_degrees, n_frames, and timeline_list.
camera_eye_start_radius, camera_eye_start_z, camera_eye_end_radius, camera_eye_end_z, and rotation_degrees are all floats.
camera_focus is a list in the form of [x,y,z]
n_frames is an int.
timeline_list is a list, keep this argument, but for now it will not be used for anything, later it will.

camera_eye_start_radius is the starting distance the camera eye is from the camera focus point.
camera_eye_end_radius is the ending distance the camera eye is from the focus point.
camera_eye_start_z is the starting height the camera eye is from the camera focus point.
camera_eye_end_z is the ending height the camera eye is from the focus point.
camera_focus is the x,y,z point the camera will be focused on.
rotation_degrees is the number of degrees the camera eye should rotate around the focus point, the default value is 360.
n_frames is the number of discrete movements the camera will make around the camera focus point.

the function should basicly work like this:
for each frame in n_frames the function should adjust the camera position proportionally between the four start and end parameter.

Basicly the camera eye will be orbiting aroud the focus point.
