# plumbing flange
Hello, I am trying to create a Flange fitting for plumbing. Can you start be creating a 200mm circle and extrude it by 10mm
Now can you create a smaller circle and extrude cut through the first body
Now we need to create bolt holes for the flange, we are using M6 bolts, and will need 10 holes.
Each hole should be equidistant form the inside and outside edges of the body
