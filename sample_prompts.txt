Hello, can you create a brass M8x45mm Hex Head screw, add a small fillet to all the edges, then add a joint origin to the top face?

Can you create a similar component, but this time for an stainless steel M12x30mm Hex Head screw?

Hello, can you create a brass M8x20mm Socket Head screw, with a small chamfer on all the edges, then add a joint origin on the top face?

Hello, can you create an M8x40mm hex head bolt, with a .5mm chamfer on all edges?



# random cubes
Hello, can you generate 30 rectangles with random sizes between 10 and 20mm. The rectangles should be quite close together so they are overlapping. Then extrude each profile by a random amount between 10 and 30mm.


# keyboard

I am designing a common TKL keyboard. It will have a main body, which should be draw as a rectangle, then extruded into a solid. On top of the body, you should create another sketch for the keys. Each key profile should be drawn as square or rectangle depending on the key. For example: number and letter keys are square, but space bar and shift keys are rectangular. Each key should be in the correct x,y position for a TKL QWERTY keyboard. You may want to create a separate sketch for each row or other logical grouping you think makes sense. Make sure to include all the keys. There should be a slight gap between each key. The keys should be extrude-joined into the body, protruding through the top, if the key sketches and the body sketch have the same z position, the keys need to be extruded at least as thick as the body. For body size, key size, key height, and key spacing, use common values for a typical TKL keyboard.
